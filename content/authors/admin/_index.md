I am an Freshman Undergradute Student at Indian Institute Of Science pursuing BS (Research) with intended major in Physics. I love pondering over tough problems that stimulate my neurons, especially in Physics and Mathemtics. I am interested in Quantum Computing, Information Theory and Cosmology but am open to any topic that tickles my fancy.
